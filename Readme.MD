# React with Typescript and Webpack Support

## Cloning Repository

You could copy these git commands below and paste it in your current working directory terminal

1. Just A React App with webpack already configured, no redux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayhanHamada/react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate.git <your desired folder>
```

2. React App with webpack already configured and redux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayhanHamada/react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate.git --branch with-redux --single-branch <your desired folder>
```

3. Same as number 2, but this is my personal prefer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayhanHamada/react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate.git --branch with-redux-my-way --single-branch <your desired folder>
```

## running

1. Start A Development Server and enable Hot Reload while developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Build The App

```bash
npm run build
```
